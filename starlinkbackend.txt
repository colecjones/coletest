"If you encounter any issues during the setup of your router, you can factory reset your router. The router will take a few minutes to reboot, and will require you to set a new Network ID and Password. 

* For circular Starlink, gently push the button on the bottom of the router until the light turns blue and release.
* For rectangular Starlink, power cycle Starlink (unplug from power and then plug back in) 3 times in a row.

**Note:** A WiFi network name is also called an SSID. A Wifi password can be referred to as a network security key, WPA key or WAP/SPA2 passphrase.Â "

We appreciate your support and interest in our most recent Starlink. We do not currently offer the option for customers to exchange their Starlink for a different model, as we are trying to get kits to as many pending orders as possible. Both Starlink units have comparable performance and will continue to receive regular software updates and support.
"Yes, you are welcome to connect your own equipment to Starlink. However, we cannot guarantee Starlink performance or compatibility with third party networking devices.

For customers with Standard (Circular) Starlink, connect the network switch via the AUX port on the Starlink router or third party router LAN port. We do not recommend or support placing network switches between the power supply and the router. Do not connect the switch to the white port on the power supply.

For customers with Standard (Rectangular) Starlink, a Starlink ethernet adapter is required to connect a network switch. Do not enable bypass mode. Bypass mode is designed to support third party routers and will only provide one IP address."
"We currently only support one issued IP address per Starlink at this time.

[How do I set my IP address to Public?](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=13f0056c-6f6d-5a55-623c-fe94ad9947c5)"
"Yes. Starlink supports VPNs that use TCP or UDP. SSL based VPNs typically work best to traverse CGNAT. NAT traversal support is required by the VPN.

We are unable to provide support for troubleshooting services for VPN connectivity issues. The Starlink App also may not work correctly when using VPN. Please contact your VPN provider for further support."
Can I use a network switch with Starlink?
Does Starlink work with VPNs?
Will enterprise site-to-site VPN or SDWAN appliances work on Starlink? 
How can I monitor my Starlink's performance? 
Starlink provides a standard 1500 byte MTU for internet access.
Yes. Like client VPN applications, NAT traversal support via TCP or UDP is required on the Starlink side of the VPN/SDWAN appliance. VPNs that rely on protocols 47 (GRE), 50 (ESP), 51 (AH), 115 (L2TP) are dropped by CGNAT at this time. 
"You can check Starlink statistics like speed, uptime, latency, outages, and alerts while your Starlink is connected to the Starlink WiFi Router. You can review stats through the Starlink mobile App (best experience) or through any web interface by typing 192.168.100.1 or dishy.starlink.com into any web browser.

For customers not using the Starlink WiFi Router, some configuration changes may be needed on your third party router for the Starlink App and the web interface to be reachable. A static route to 192.168.100.1 with a next hop of your router WAN interface is required. We are unable to provide exact instructions for each third party router. Please note, some third party routers may automatically work if DHCP option 121 is supported.

Data Usage Tracker to track monthly Priority Access data can be found on the Starlink account webpage by logging into your Starlink account and select ""Manage"" next to the Starlink you wish to see data for. To view your data usage through the Starlink App, select the ""person"" icon. If the data usage tracker does not appear in the Starlink App, ensure your Starlink App is updated to the latest version."

Your service will remain active until the end of the payment period. Service will be canceled for future billing cycles.

Once we receive your Starlink and verify its condition, your refund will be processed. For additional questions, please refer to the Terms of Service.

Business Pro
When can I expect my order to ship?
While tree branches often cause intermittent service by disrupting the connection between Starlink and satellites, many Starlink customers live in an area with a lot of trees. Prior to order, we recommend downloading the Starlink app and using the "Check for Obstructions" tool to assess your field of view. If your set up location has obstructions, consider an elevated install as the height improves the chances of clearing nearby obstructions.

I am tax exempt based on belonging to a qualifying group, how do I apply?
"If you reside in the US or Canada and belong to a qualifying group, The Metis or First Nations groups, please upload one of the following items along with your support ticket:
* A copy of the front and back of a current First Nation or ID card 
* Other proof of tribal membership (A letter from a tribe on First Nation Letterhead as long as it includes Name, DOB and treaty number is also acceptable)

US ONLY: In addition to the above listed proof, refer to your stateâ€™s Department of Revenue website, complete the Native American Tax Exemption form per your stateâ€™s financial system.

"Starlink is designed and tested to handle a wide range of temperatures and weather conditions including snow, hail, sleet, heavy rain, and extreme heat. Starlink is not designed to handle hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, meteors, dinosaurs, or other extreme forces of nature.

* **Temperature** - Starlink is rated to operate outdoors between -30 to +50 degrees Celsius, or -22 to +122 degrees Fahrenheit, and the router and power supply are also rated to operate indoors between 0 to +30 degrees Celsius, or +32 to +86 degrees Fahrenheit. During moments of extreme heat or cold, Starlink may experience slightly reduced performance.
* **Snow** - Starlink also has the ability to melt snow! This feature helps prevent service degradation during wintry conditions. We recommend installing Starlink in a location that avoids snow build-up and other obstructions from blocking the field of view.
* **Rain** - Starlink  is designed to operate in wet conditions; it's hydrophobic and has a low affinity to water. In extreme cases, heavy rain or wind may affect your connection, potentially leading to slower speeds or a rare outage. It is strongly recommended that you do not apply additional protective covers as this will degrade Starlinkâ€™s performance including its ability to melt snow.
* **Lightning** - Starlink meets the U.S. National Electrical Code (NEC) grounding requirements. However, if you live in an area with lightning, an external lightning protection system (lightning rod, ground rod, surge protector, etc.) may reduce susceptibility to lightning. For added protection during a lightning storm, or when it is left unattended and unused for long periods of time, unplug the product from the wall AC outlet and disconnect the Starlink cable. This may prevent damage to the product from lightning and power line surges."
What do the lights on my WiFi router / power supply mean?
How do I factory reset my router?
I live in an area with snow, heavy rain, wind, lightning, or extreme temperatures - can I still use Starlink?
"If you encounter any issues during the setup or use of your router, you can factory reset it. The router will take a few minutes to reboot, and will require you to reconnect and set a new Network ID and Password. Network name will appear as ""STINKY"" or ""STARLINK"" in device WiFi settings.

**Standard (Circular):** Gently push the button on the bottom of the router until the light turns blue and release.

**Standard (Rectangular) & High Performance:** Power cycle Starlink (unplug the router from power and then plug back in) 6 times in a row. The router will take a few minutes to reboot, and will interrupt your service until you set up again. You can expect the light on the bottom of the router to be illuminated when complete. There are no lights on the front of the router.
**Starlink Mesh router:**
1. Power cycle the mesh (unplug from power and then plug back in) 6 times in a row.
2. When repairing the node, make sure you connect to your primary Starlink router's network. Do not connect to your mesh node's new ""STINKY"" or ""STARLINK"" network that appears after plugging it in.
3. Open the Starlink App. After 1-2 minutes, the Starlink App will prompt you with a ""PAIR MESH NODE"" notification.

**Note:** A WiFi network name is also called an SSID. A Wifi password can be referred to as a network security key, WPA key or WAP/SPA2 passphrase. "

Starlink Subscription
Can I pause service?
"Yes. Pausing service is available for a lower monthly subscription fee for customers who have been actively subscribed for a minimum of 3 months. Service can be paused for a minimum of 2 months and a maximum of 6 months. 

During a pause, your Starlink will no longer receive service, but your spot will be held in the network until you are ready to use it again. Your service pause will begin at the start of the scheduled month's billing cycle. At the end of the pause, service will be reactivated and billing will revert to the current standard subscription fee at that time. 

To pause service: 
- Select your service location from your Account page. Select ""Pause Service"", enter the month you would like to begin the pause and the desired duration, and select ""Update Subscription"". The page will be updated with the scheduled start date and duration of pause. 
- You can edit the pause start date, edit the pause duration, or cancel your pause early within your location details. To cancel your pause early, select 'Delete' and service will be scheduled to reactivate on the next billing cycle. You are not able to cancel the pause for immediate return of service."

"To stow your Starlink for return or storage, open the settings within the Starlink App and click ""Stow.""

If your Starlink is not connected to the App, you can manually stow your Starlink:

1. Make sure Starlink is plugged in.
2. Take Starlink out of the base.
3. Place Starlink face down on a flat surface like a table. After about a minute, the Starlink mast will automatically tilt into the stow position.
4. Once the Starlink stows, unplug the device so that it remains in stow position.




Note: Using the Starlink App to ""Stow"" the Flat High Performance Starlink will disable the internet connection. If unable to 'Stow' from the Starlink App, you can disconnect the power source. Manual Stow is not required."

Credit Note
"Common reasons for loss of internet include: hardware disconnection, cable damage, or outages.

1. Check for alerts, obstructions, or outages in the Starlink App. 
2. Make sure everything is securely connected according to the set up guide and plugged into an indoor, grounded, 3-pin AC outlet that receives power.
3. Check the light on your WiFi router/power supply. See light guidance [here.](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=37332b75-b5d7-c97f-2019-2ebab4ae5bdf) 
4. Verify there is no damage to Starlink, cables, or connectors. Cuts, hard bends, or alterations to cables can impact service. 
5. Disconnect all 3rd party (non-Starlink) hardware connected in your Starlink setup and try again.
6. Power cycle Starlink by unplugging from power and then plugging back in.   

If your router light is solid white, you should be getting service from Starlink. 
1. Try accessing the internet with another device (mobile phone, tablet, laptop). If this works, your issue is likely device specific, not a Starlink issue. You may need to check the WiFi settings on the problematic device, or contact your device manufacturer. Be sure your device is running on the latest software version.
2. Try accessing another website ([starlink.com](https://www.starlink.com/) for example). If this works, your issue is likely website-specific, not a Starlink issue.

The fastest way to get questions answered is by using the Support Help Center! From the moment your Starlink Kit is ready to ship, you can file a ticket to contact Support by clicking thumbs down to "Did this answer your question?"
"Your Starlink needs a clear view of the sky so it can stay connected with satellites as they move overhead. Objects that obstruct the connection between your Starlink and the satellite, such as a tree branch, pole, or roof, will cause service interruptions. Use the Starlink App ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starlink/id1537177988), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starlink.mobile)) to check for obstructions and find the install location that will deliver the best service.

Many customers find that a permanent mount in an elevated location, like a roof, pole, or wall, provides the best installation and service.  For best results, Starlink should be installed as close to vertical as possible. Additional mounts and cable routing accessories are available for purchase on the [ Starlink Shop ](https://shop.starlink.com) once your Starlink Kit is ready to ship. Before you order, you can preview accessories in the [Starlink Accessories Guide](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=5aec169f-4cbb-72a1-60eb-14a49cbd2858).

"Starlink is designed and tested to handle a wide range of temperatures and weather conditions including snow, hail, sleet, heavy rain, and extreme heat. Starlink is not designed to handle hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, meteors, dinosaurs, or other extreme forces of nature.

* **Temperature** - Starlink is rated to operate outdoors between -30 to +50 degrees Celsius, or -22 to +122 degrees Fahrenheit, and the router and power supply are also rated to operate indoors between 0 to +30 degrees Celsius, or +32 to +86 degrees Fahrenheit. During moments of extreme heat or cold, Starlink may experience slightly reduced performance.
* **Snow** - Starlink also has the ability to melt snow! This feature helps prevent service degradation during wintry conditions. We recommend installing Starlink in a location that avoids snow build-up and other obstructions from blocking the field of view.
* **Rain** - Starlink  is designed to operate in wet conditions; it's hydrophobic and has a low affinity to water. In extreme cases, heavy rain or wind may affect your connection, potentially leading to slower speeds or a rare outage. It is strongly recommended that you do not apply additional protective covers as this will degrade Starlinkâ€™s performance including its ability to melt snow.
* **Lightning** - Starlink meets the U.S. National Electrical Code (NEC) grounding requirements. However, if you live in an area with lightning, an external lightning protection system (lightning rod, ground rod, surge protector, etc.) may reduce susceptibility to lightning. For added protection during a lightning storm, or when it is left unattended and unused for long periods of time, unplug the product from the wall AC outlet and disconnect the Starlink cable. This may prevent damage to the product from lightning and power line surges.

For users or businesses who require higher performance while living in the most extreme weather conditions, we recommend High Performance Starlink. The larger, High Performance Starlink comes with better snow melt capabilities as well as the ability to have faster speeds in high temperature environments. For businesses, please visit [Starlink Business.](https://www.starlink.com/business)

What is Starlink Mesh?
How do I set up Starlink Mesh?
"**Set Up**Â 

1. Start by making sure your Starlink Kit is set up and connected to the internet prior to setting up your mesh nodes. Connect to your existing Starlink WiFi network from your device.
2. Plug in your Starlink mesh node to a power outlet. See below for mesh placement tips.
3. Open the Starlink App. Wait 1-2 minutes for a ""PAIR NEW MESH NODE"" notification to appear in the App.
4. Click ""PAIR"". This node will begin connecting on the NETWORK screen. Connection will take about 1-2 minutes.
5. Upon connection, the node will appear on the NETWORK screen in the App.
6. Repeat with additional nodes.

See the [Starlink Mesh Install Guide](https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Starlink_Mesh_Installation_Guide.pdf) for more information.

**Mesh Placement Tips**

* Mesh nodes work best when theyâ€™re placed no more than one to two rooms apart from each other.Â The bigger your house, the more mesh nodes you will need to cover the area.
* Before you set up your Mesh nodes, use the WiFi Scanner on the Starlink App to analyze the signal strength of your existing Starlink router to see where you may need more coverage.
* Make sure mesh nodes on different floors are not directly on top of each other, as signal is weaker directly above and below the router, and stronger from the sides.
* See [How can I improve my WiFi connectivity?](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=f28de520-ef3f-138d-9f69-7f1b37433f1e)Â for more detailed tips on optimizing your environment, like placing your router in an upright position, in an open area, and away from sources of interference.

"**What is the Range App tool?**

The purpose of the Range tool is to create a visualization of WiFi signal strength throughout your home. In the areas of weaker signal, you may want to consider purchasing a [Starlink Mesh Router](https://shop.starlink.com) to help wirelessly extend your network.Â 


**How do I use the Range tool?**

Navigate to the Range tool from the Starlink App home page. Walk around your home to measure signal strength. Press â€œView Resultsâ€ to view a summary of signal strength around your home.Â 

Note: This tool requires App version 2.0.28 or later, as well as camera permissions.


**Does the Range tool work with third party routers?**

No, since the Starlink router tells the App what your deviceâ€™s signal strength is, the Range tool is only compatible with the Starlink router. Â "

If you were online before, then suddenly fell offline and are unable to regain connection, this means that there is no data connection between the router and the Starlink. A Starlink app banner may appear saying ""Offline â€” Starlink Disconnected"". This is most commonly caused by a damaged cable or connector:

* Check the length of the cable for any damage.
* Carefully inspect the cable connectors on both ends for any debris, signs of water ingression possibly resulting in short circuits, or visible physical damage. If needed, a replacement cable can be purchased in the [Starlink Shop](https://shop.starlink.com).

"Router placement is critical for a successful set up and strong WiFi connection.

**Tips for good placement**:

* **Central location**: Your router should be centrally located in your home in the area where you most often use your devices (mobile phone, tablet, computer).
* **Flat surface**: Place your router on a hard, flat surface like a table, countertop, shelf, or nightstand. Surfaces that are up at least halfway up the room are better than the floor if possible â€“ signal emits mainly along the same plane it is placed in.
* **Open space**: The router communicates best when it is not closed in. Avoid cabinets, media consoles, and closets.
* **Upright position**: Place your router on its base â€“ do not lay it down on its side. Check and see if your router may have tipped over accidentally if you are suddenly having issues.
* **Few barriers**: The best connection will be when your router is in the same room, or about 1-2 rooms away. The thinner the wall, the further the signal can go. For older houses that may have more dense wall materials like plaster, you may want to try placing your routers closer to the door (wood is less dense).
* **Avoid Interference**: Try to avoid common in-home causes of interference like major appliances (microwaves, refrigerators), thick materials (metals, concrete, or brick), and other sources of interference including fluorescent lights, other WiFi networks, and bad electrical connections. Try to place the router at least 20 feet away from these sources.
**Tools in the Starlink App**:
* The â€œ**Range**â€ tool allows you to measure your Starlink WiFi signal strength in real time as you walk around your home and reports a summary at the end. This can advise where you may need to adjust router placement or place a mesh node.
* The â€œ**Network**â€ tab allows you to view the signal strength of each of your devices connected to your WiFi.
* From Settings, there is an option to split the WiFi bands. The 2.4GHz band provides a longer range but may experience more interference than the 5GHz band. The 5GHz band uses shorter waves, which makes it harder for the signal to penetrate walls and solid objects (making the range smaller) but will encounter less interference.

After following the guidance above, and you are experiencing slow speeds or difficulty with your WiFi connectivity â€“ see â€œ[I am experiencing slow speeds](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=4799810f-856c-e67b-2443-0626a5277822)â€.

"Starlink provides two IP policies, ""default"" and ""public"". The default IP configuration is Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT) using private address space assigned to Starlink clients with DHCP from the 10.64.0.0/10 network. Network Address Translation (NAT) translates between Starlink private and public IPs.Â 

The Starlink public IP policy is an optional configuration available to Business and Maritime customers. A public IP is reachable from any device on the internet and is assigned to Starlink network clients using DHCP. Moving the Starlink to another location may cause the public IP to change. Starlink does not currently offer the ability for Residential or Roam customers to receive a public IP. The public IP option can be enabled from the account dashboard. See instructionsÂ [here](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=13f0056c-6f6d-5a55-623c-fe94ad9947c5).

Each Starlink is allocated one IPv4 address and delegated a /56 IPv6 prefix for network clients.
All Starlink network clients are assigned an IPv6 address if the router is IPv6 is capable.Â IPv6 is not supported on the early generation router in the Circular Starlink Kit.

The default IP policy using CGNAT blocks all inbound ports. Customers requiring inbound ports should consider products with a public IP option. The following outbound ports are blocked for all customers per information security best practices: TCP/25 (SMTP) and TCP/445 (SMB).

As Starlink continues to expand and upgrade our global internet service infrastructure and rollout new capabilities, some users may see different IP address behavior (for example, publicly routable addresses, IPv6, non-CGNAT).

Speed Issues (Consistent - Outside of Peak Hours)
"**Best Effort Service:** Starlink prioritizes network resources for Starlink Maritime users at sea and on terrestrial waters. Starlink Maritime service is provided on a best effort basis; stated speeds and uninterrupted use of services are not guaranteed. Starlink is not intended or registered for use as a Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) service at this time. 

**Coastal Waters:** Starlink for Maritime should only be used in territorial waters where licensing is either held by SpaceX or the end user. Starlink Maritime is currently approved for use in the US.

**FCC Authorization Notice.** Federal Communication Commission authorization to Starlink for in-motion services in the United States has been granted on a non-interference protected basis, i.e., unprotected basis with respect to operations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. Therefore, Starlinkâ€™s in-motion operations, including for vessels, must accept any interference received from both current and future services authorized in the band â€“ even if such interference causes undesirable operations for Starlink Services and its customers. Starlink in-motion Services must not cause harmful interference to any authorized service in the band, whether licensed or not."

"Peak hours are between 6pm and 11pm local time. If you are experiencing slow speed issues in or around these hours, see [Speed Issues (Variable - During Peak Hours)](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=4799810f-856c-e67b-2443-0626a5277822).

If you are experiencing speed issues consistently throughout the day, it may be a Router/WiFi issue or your local setup.

1. Check the Starlink app home screen for any alerts indicating network outages, obstructions, or hardware issues.
2. Ensure your Starlink is being used in the correct service location listed on your account.  If you have Starlink Roam service or are using portability away from your service address, you may experience slower speeds.Â 
3. Check that nothing is blocking Starlinkâ€™s view that may be affecting the signal, including heavy dirt or debris or any covering on the face of the Starlink. See [How do I clean my Starlink? ](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=587a41e0-9ab4-85ae-0aec-c3f163863436)for additional tips.
4. Power cycle your Starlink and router by unplugging and re-plugging the AC cable from your wall outlet.
5. Remove all 3rd party hardware and conduct a speed test during off-peak hours using the Starlink app and router.Â The Starlink app offers a few different speed tests which can help you determine where the slow point in your connection is.Â 
   * App to Internet - The 'speedometer'Â speedÂ test is the standard test. This measures the speed from your device to the internet, similar to Fast.com or Ookla speedtests.
   * App to Router - found under â€˜Advancedâ€™. This measures the speed of the WiFi connection to your starlink router. If you are experiencing slow speeds on the app to router speed test:
      * Confirm your device has good signal strength and is using the 5Ghz band. See the 'Network' screen in the app for more client information.
     * UseÂ the WiFi Scanner in the app to determine the best locationÂ ofÂ your router. Also, you can visit theÂ Starlink ShopÂ to purchase a mesh node to extend the connection throughout your home.
     *  See [How can I improve my WiFi connectivity?](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=f28de520-ef3f-138d-9f69-7f1b37433f1e)Â for more detailed tips on optimizing your environment, like placing your router in an upright position, in an open area, and away from sources of interference.

"Your Starlink needs a clear view of the sky so it can stay connected with satellites as they move overhead. Objects that obstruct the connection between your Starlink and the satellite, such as a tree branch, pole, or roof, will cause service interruptions. Use the Starlink app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starlink/id1537177988), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starlink.mobile)) to check for obstructions and find the install location that will deliver the best service.

Many customers find that a permanent mount in an elevated location, like a roof, pole, or wall, provides the best installation and service.  Ensure Starlink is installed as close to vertical as possible. Additional mounts and cable routing accessories are available for purchase on the [ Starlink Shop ](https://shop.starlink.com) once your Starlink Kit is ready to ship.

What is Starlink Best Effort service?
"Best Effort is a service option offered to existing pre-order customers in areas where Residential service is currently at capacity. It enables typical internet activity with the understanding that Best Effort users will be deprioritized behind Residential users, resulting in slower speeds.  

Best Effort uses the same hardware as Residential and the monthly service charge is the same, but unlike Residential, Best Effort users will have the option to pause service."
Yes. If you would like to maintain your place in line, but no longer wish to use Best Effort service, we recommend to hold on to your Starlink hardware and pause service to not be charged. You can un-pause at any time, while waiting to be converted to Residential service. Cancelling your Best Effort service will cancel your place in line for Residential service.

Starlink is easy to set up!

1. **Find a clear view of the sky.**Â  Use the ""Check for Obstructions"" tool on the Starlink app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starlink/id1537177988), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starlink.mobile)) to find the install location that will deliver the best service.
2. **Plug Starlink into power.**
3. **Within a few minutes, your Starlink will connect to satellites.**
Â  Â * First, Starlink will automatically level itself to search for satellites overhead. Do NOT attempt to manually adjust your Starlink.
Â  Â * Next, Starlink will make an initial connection to the Starlink constellation and tilt to the optimum angle for satellite coverage - slightly north or south based on your location in the northern or southern hemisphere.
4.**Connect to high-speed Starlink internet from your device!**
Â  * Note: Your Starlink may need to download the latest software after initial setup for optimal performance. This will happen automatically overnight or you can watch your Starlink app for messages about the update status.

If you don't see the ""PAIR NEW MESH NODE"" notification in your Starlink App within ~2 minutes of plugging in the new node:

1. **You may be too far away from your primary Starlink router.**
   *  Try finding a closer location to your primary router to complete the pairing process. 
2. **You may have connected directly to the mesh node's ""STINKY"" or ""STARLINK"" network instead of staying connected to your 
 primary Starlink router's network.**
   *  Try a factory reset to start the process over. Power cycle your mesh node at least 6 times, on roughly 
 a 2-3 second interval (about as fast as you can probably manage to plug and unplug it), then let it boot.
   *  Do not connect directly to your mesh node's new ""STINKY"" or ""STARLINK"" network after plugging it in.

   *  You cannot add a Starlink mesh router into an existing 3rd party mesh system. 
4. **You may be using an outdated version of the Starlink App.**
   *   Update your App if there is an update available.

Your Starlink Kit includes everything you need to connect to the internet including your Starlink, WiFi router/power supply, cables, and base.

The Starlink base is designed for ground level installation, or to support a quick start setup to test your internet connection. Many customers find that a permanent mount provides the best installation and service. Additional mounts and accessories are available for purchase on theÂ [Starlink Shop](https://shop.starlink.com)Â once your Starlink Kit is ready to ship. 

To view hardware specifications, please [click here](https://www.starlink.com/specifications) and select your Starlink model."
"Your Starlink has Snow Melt functionality, which allows it to automatically use the power it draws to heat itself to melt the snow off. This feature helps to prevent impacts on service, while also preventing the need for you to get on the roof to remove the snow from your Starlink.

Icicles themselves should also not impact performance. If you prefer, you can gently remove ice at any time. Most of the time, ice will not impact service, but could prevent the motors from moving if Starlink needs to be repositioned. We recommend against using tools (picks, chisels) to prevent damaging your Starlink.

If the base of your Starlink is impeded by snow build up or ice, you may get an alert through the Starlink App that motors are blocked. If you get this alert, you may need to gently remove the ice/icicles to allow Starlink to reposition, but this should rarely happen.

Heavy snow accumulation on the top of your Starlink could have impacts on your service. If your Starlink is completely covered with heavy snow, this would most likely result in an intermittent connection or in no service at all. We recommend that you install your Starlink in a location that will not be buried in the snow, or on areas of your home where snow is not known to build up.

"Performance beyond Standard includes:
* Improved weather resistance. High performance is rated IP56, or resistant to water jets. Standard is rated IP54, or resistant to water spray. 
* Better performance in hot weather. Download speeds are typically 3x better at > 35Â°C (95Â°F)
* Better performance in the snow: 1.7x better snow melt capability (Inches/hour).
* Better visibility of satellites. Your Starlink needs a clear view of the sky so it can stay connected with satellites as they move overhead. The High Performance can see 35% more sky, allowing it to connect to more satellites and better serve users with atypical installations, unavoidable obstructions, or in polar (>59 degrees latitude) and equatorial regions where there are fewer visible satellites.

Flat High Performance Starlink is the same as described above, except this particular Starlink model does not have a built-in motor for motorized self-orientation.

See [Starlink Specifications](https://www.starlink.com/specifications?spec=1) for more information.

For additional service features, [Starlink Business](https://www.starlink.com/business) provides high throughput connectivity for offices of up to 20 users, storefronts, and demanding workloads across the globe.

"**Standard & High Performance**

The base that comes with your Starlink is designed to support a ground level installation or a quick setup to test your internet connection. Consider a permanent installation in an elevated location, like a roof, pole, or wall if you cannot avoid obstructions or find a clear field of view from the ground level. Many customers find that a permanent mount provides the best installation and service. [Standard Accessories Guide](https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Accessories_Guide_Rectangular.pdf) / [High Performance Accessories Guide](https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Accessories_Guide_High_Performance.pdf).





**Flat High Performance**

A Wedge mount is included with your Starlink Kit purchase. Your Starlink is designed to be mounted at 8Â° on a horizontal surface to help prevent rain or snow build-up. Mounting your Starlink in a vertical position (e.g., on the side of your chimney), will not allow it to operate.





Additional mounts and cable routing accessories are available for purchase on the [Starlink Shop](https://shop.starlink.com) once your Starlink Kit is ready to ship. While all mounts are designed for self install, please reach out to a roofing or installation professional if you have any questions or do not feel comfortable completing the install yourself. Â "

"Basic Access is defined at the plan-specific level as described in Starlink's [Fair Use Policy](https://www.starlink.com/legal).

For Residential service plans, download and upload are queued behind other users with Priority Access, which may result in slower speeds. During times of peak network congestion, users will be able to engage in typical internet activity like email, online shopping, or even downloading an SD movie, but may not be able to engage in activities like online gaming, video calls or downloading 4k and HD movies.

Roam and Best Effort service plans are permanently Basic Access.

For all other service plans, users are bitrate limited to 1 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload as described by Starlink's [Fair Use Policy](https://www.starlink.com/legal).

"To ensure our customer base is not negatively impacted by a small number of users consuming unusually high amounts of data, the Starlink team is implementing a Fair Use policy for Residential customers in the US and Canada and all Business/Maritime customers beginning no earlier than April 2023.

Under the Fair Use policy, customers will be provided with unlimited data, and will start each month with Priority Access, which means their data usage will be prioritized during times of network congestion.  

If a customer exceeds the amount of Priority Access outlined in their service plan on a monthly basis, they will automatically be switched to Basic Access. Users will be able to opt-in to automatic upgrades back to Priority Access from their account page. 

You can now start to monitor your data usage on your account page and in the Starlink App. For more details on service plan, see Starlinkâ€™s Fair Use policy [here](https://www.starlink.com/legal).

Ensure you have followed all of the steps:
1. **Find a clear view of the sky.**Â  Use the ""Check for Obstructions"" tool on the Starlink app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starlink/id1537177988), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starlink.mobile)) to find the install location that will deliver the best service.
2. **Plug Starlink into power.**
3. **Within a few minutes, your Starlink will connect to satellites.**
Â  Â * First, Starlink will automatically level itself to search for satellites overhead. Do NOT attempt to manually adjust your Starlink.
Â  Â * Next, Starlink will make an initial connection to the Starlink constellation and tilt to the optimum angle for satellite coverage - slightly north or south based on your location in the northern or southern hemisphere.
4.**Connect to high-speed Starlink internet from your device!**
Â  * Note: Your Starlink may need to download the latest software after initial setup for optimal performance. This will happen automatically overnight or you can watch your Starlink app for messages about the update status.

4. A statement (invoice) will generate 7 days prior to the due date as a reminder for upcoming charges each month. Find the statement in your account and in your email.
   * You can make an early payment manually in your account within this 7 day period prior to your due date.
   *  If a pause or cancellation is initiated after the statement has generated in your account, you are responsible for that payment and your Starlink service will be scheduled to pause the following month. Please ensure any changes to your subscription are made prior to the bill generating.
   *  Please keep in mind February is a shorter month, so you may see two statements generated in March.Â  
 5. You can return Starlink within 30 days of receipt for a full hardware refund. This allows time to test your Starlink and set up location to make sure Starlink is a good fit for you.

To view other billing details, such as balance, statements, payment history and automatic payment information, please visit the ""Billing"" tab in your [Account](https://www.starlink.com/account/billing).

"No. Although Starlink Portability enables users to use their Starlink terminal in other locations, users will have less priority on the network. If you are going to be in a different area for an extended period of time, Starlink requires you to change your registered service address location (subject to availability) to ensure the best experience. Users who stay in the same area outside their service address location for an extended period of time may see a further decrease in performance to accommodate users at their service address.

Note: Portability is not available for Residential service in the US. You may change your service address or change your service plan to RV through your Starlink account.

"The following does not apply to users with RV and Maritime service plans:
 
1. Log into your Starlink [account](https://www.starlink.com/account/home)
2. Under ""Your Starlinks"" select ""Manage"" next to the Starlink you would like to update the service address for
3. Select the ""pencil icon"" next to ""Service Address""
4. Enter the new service address
5. Save

Note: US Residential service plan cost is subject to change dependent on service location.
 
**Change Successful:**
By changing your Service Address, you may not be able to return to your original address. Once updated, service at your previous address will be disconnected. Service is only guaranteed at the Service Address on your order. If you move Starlink outside of its assigned area, a satellite will not be scheduled to serve Starlink and you may not receive internet or may receive degraded service. 
 
**Change Unsuccessful:**
If the service address change was unsuccessful, it is possible the area is at capacity or not active for service yet. You can view Starlink's service availability map at [starlink.com/map](https://www.starlink.com/map). Alternatively, we recommend adding deprioritized [Portability service](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=1426e78a-7384-0334-3fc0-ddf5a76d7afe) for a fee. Portability enables use in a different location, including use in a different country for 2 months within the same continent without a need to update your service address.

Note: Portability is not available for Residential service in the US. You may change your service plan to RV through your Starlink account.
 
**Changing Country:**
Your new service address cannot be located in a different country than the country used upon initial sign-up.
* Temporary use away from service address: We recommend adding deprioritized [Portability service](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=1426e78a-7384-0334-3fc0-ddf5a76d7afe) for a fee. 
* Permanent move: To permanently transfer a Starlink account to a different country, see the transfer requirements [here](https://support.starlink.com/?topic=f3cad923-ed28-f957-365c-787f8fe2e4a2). "

How does billing work for business?
Why do I need a service address for a mobile plan? 
How many terminals can I link to a subscription? 
"What should I do if my boxes or kits are damaged? 	"
"If your order arrives damaged, please contact Starlink Support via your Starlink account. Indicate how many boxes/Starlinks are damaged along with any photos if possible. 

"
If I have 2 terminals on my Premium Mobile subscription, how do the terminals get service/how does switching work? 
"Starlink does not do load balancing or switching, instead both terminals will be active utilizing time division duplexing. 

3rd party edge routers can be used to support load balancing. If using this type of set up, you can bypass the Starlink routers, and connect both dishes to the 3rd party router. If load balancing is supported, then the router will automatically switch its connection to the dish provided the best level of service in the moment.

"
Can an existing Starlink purchased from a retailer or end-user be transferred to a Reseller account? 
Do you offer role based access control? 
Restricted portal access is not supported at this time. Each contact on the account will have the same access and notifications. 
How do I make a token via API?
One service line accommodates one subscription, one service address and one terminal. Customers with a Premium Mobility plan can have one service line that accommodates one subscription for one service address and 1 or 2 terminals.
"A service address is required on your account, regardless of mobility status, for taxing and invoicing requirements. The service address listed on the account will not affect where the Starlink can be used. In order to ensure there are no disruptions to service or billing, your service address must be located within the country on the account. 

If you are a Business account and need help determining the country listed on your account, please reach out to customer support."
If I cancel service as a business account, when will it end?
"Accounts with API access are able to make tokens using API.

To make a token on the API, use your Client ID in combination with ""client secret"" to request an authorization token to be able to call API endpoints.
* OIDC can be used for authentication and bearer tokens (https://openid.net/connect/)
* (https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) can be used to authorize requests
If your client ID is in all caps, you should be able to get the correct client ID from the URL. 

API access is provided to larger business customers to manage accounts, user terminals, and service.

"Eligible Starlink kits and services purchased from Starlink directly can be transferred to Authorized Resellers. Currently only High Performance and Flat High Performance are eligible for transfer to Resellers. 


Instructions to transfer your Starlink to a Reseller as an end-user:

1. End-User needs to cancel service for the service line to be transferred
	*  This can be completed via the dashboard from the "" Manage"" button under the home page
	*  Select ""Cancel Service"" for the Starlink you wish to transfer

2. End-User will need to click the ""Transfer"" button on the dashboard to unlock the kit from their account
	* This can be completed via your Starlink account from the ""Manage"" button under the home page
	* In the ""Devices"" section, locate the Starlink being transferred and select ""Transfer""
	* **Note:** Selecting this button will stop service immediately regardless of time left in the current billing cycle. The ""Transfer"" button will only be accessible after the service is cancelled. 

3. End-user will need to communicate the Starlink ID to the Reseller
	* Your Starlink ID can be found under the ""manage"" button under the DashboardÂ 

4. Reseller will need to add the serial number to their accountÂ 
	*  Reseller will need to do this via the ""Add and Unlock Starlinks"" button under the Dashboard Page
	*  Reseller will need to do this via the [POST] function under ""User Terminal""Â 

5. Reseller will need to create a new service line to activate service for that StarlinkÂ 

	*  This can be completed via the home page under ""All Service Lines""
	*  This can be completed via the API via the [POST] function under ""Service Line"" and the [POST] function under ""User Terminal""
	*  **Note**: There may be an overlap for the first billing period when the kit is transferred; reseller is responsible for managing expectations with the end user.

"Once service is cancelled via API, the ""endDate"" for service cancellation is set to the day before the next billing day of the month. This ensures you are not billed for the cancelled service line in the next billing cycle. 

The ""serviceEndDate"" reflects when the Starlink will stop receiving service - this  should be set to the day before the billing day of the month.

"As a Business account, you will have a billing day of the month. The billing day of the month will be the day the invoice is generated and emailed to you. By default, payments are due 7 days after invoice generation.

The billing day of the month is linked at an account level and is based off the date you activate your first subscription. After your first subscription, all active subscriptions on the account, regardless of activation date, will be billed on the billing day of the month.  

Example: If a subscription is activated on 2/10, the billing day of the month becomes the 10th. The first invoice will be generated on 3/10 and will bill for usage from 3/10-4/10. Therefore, usage from 2/10-3/10 is not charged. If another subscription on the same account is activated on 2/15, usage from 2/15-3/10 will not be charged. An invoice will then generate on the 10th including both subscriptions for usage from 3/10-4/10.

What is Starlink Roam (previously known as â€œStarlink for RVsâ€)
Starlink Roam is available for land use within your continent (Regional plan) or across the globe (Global plan).  It can be ordered in any country where Starlink is available on the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/map).
"Starlink Roam (previously known as â€œStarlink for RVsâ€) provides immediate access to high-speed, low-latency internet on an as-needed basis at any destination where Starlink provides active coverage.  Both Regional and Global plans are available.

 Regional plans are geo-fenced to work on land within the same continent as the registered Shipping Address, while the Global plans work on land anywhere there is active service coverage. If you use Starlink in a foreign country for more than two months, you may be required to update your account to your new location. Starlink Roam provides Best Effort service â€“ there is no priority access included in the plan.

In-motion use is supported for designated kits. Visit https://www.starlink.com/specifications for a description of the Starlink Kit models designated for in-motion use."

**Limitations of reactivation:**

* **Availability** - The ability to reactivate service is dependent on capacity in other areas. You can view Starlink's service availability map on [starlink.com/map.](https://www.starlink.com/map)
* **Unauthorized retailer/reseller** - we are unable to activate service for a Starlink that has been purchased from an unauthorized retailer or reseller. 
* **Country Moves** - We do not support Starlink reactivation in a different country at this time. To use Starlink in a different country, you must create an account in the desired country.

"* **Best Effort Service:** Network resources are always de-prioritized for RoamÂ users compared to other Starlink services, resulting in degraded service and slower speeds in congested areas and during peak hours.

If you use Starlink in a foreign country for more than two months, you will be required to move your account to your new location or purchase an additional Starlink to maintain service.

* **In-Motion Use:** In-motion use is prohibited for undesignated kits and countries. You are prohibited from installing or using a kit on a moving vehicle or vessel unless Starlink has designated your specific kit model and/or mount for in-motion use and has obtained all required in-motion approvals in the country of use. Services in-motion on a vehicle or vessel (e.g. cars, vans, RVs, boats) via an unauthorized kit or in an unapproved country will void the limited warranty of your kit.Â

"**Examples that lead to intermittent connection:**
- Obstructions
- Installation outside of service address
- Improper Starlink dish installation and/or router placement
- Hardware & cable damage
- 3rd party devices


-----
**Recommended steps:**

**1: Visit the Starlink App and check if any alerts have appeared:**

* If there are no alerts banners displaying in the Starlink App, proceed to step 2.
    

**2: Reboot router and confirm if all or some devices are experiencing intermittent service:**

* If some devices, then move the device closer to the router and see if the issue continues. If continues, proceed to step 3.
* If all devices, then proceed to step 3.


		
**3: Inspect hardware for any visible damage:**
* Check cables for nicks, cuts, and hard bends. If jammed in any doorways and window panes, this can result in degraded service.
* Check ports for any debris or damage.
* If no damage was found, proceed to step 4.
    
    

**4: Disconnect any 3rd party hardware in your Starlink setup:**
* If the disconnections do not continue, then the 3rd party hardware used in your setup is the root cause for the experienced disconnections. We are unable to guarantee service quality performance with 3rd party hardware.
* If the disconnections continue, proceed to step 5.



**5: Confirm the Starlink dish is securely installed where the mast will not sway with the wind:**
* If the Starlink dish installation allows for swaying or movement of the Starlink mast, degraded service is expected. Please visit shop.starlink.com to view alternative mount options.
*  If the Starlink dish has a secure installation, proceed to step 6.



**6: Click the thumbs down icon to submit a support ticket with the following information:**
1. If possible, attach clear photos of your Starlink dish installation, cable routing, router placement, and any other photos you feel may be helpful to resolve your issue.
2. Is your Starlink power connected directly to a wall outlet? If not, include how you are powering your Starlink.
3. When do you first recall experiencing the disconnections?
4. Are the disconnections only present while using specific programs/applications?
5. Are the disconnections only present during certain times of the day or constant throughout the day?

"
"1. On the Starlink App, use the ""Visibility"" map to identify the location of your obstructions
2.  Try to move Starlink to a new location, remove the obstruction, or mount at a more elevated location, like a roof, pole, or wall. For best results, Starlink should be installed as close to vertical as possible. Mount solutions are available on the [Starlink Shop](https://shop.starlink.com/).
3.  To estimate how obstructed a new potential location is, use the ""Check for Obstructionsâ€ tool under ""Visibility."" Follow the guided experience to scan Starlink's field of view using the camera.
    * Note: if you move locations, the ""Visibilityâ€ map could take up to 12 hours to populate.
    * Repeat as needed in multiple locations.

For additional help, contact Support for a consultation. If possible, attach clear photos of your Starlink dish installation and surrounding area, and any other photos you feel may be helpful to resolve your issue."

We will continue working to get your order shipped out as soon as possible. Please continue to watch your order summary for status. Thank you for your patience and for your support!** 

Please visit your [Account page](https://www.starlink.com/account/home) for the most up-to-date estimate on when you can expect your order to be fulfilled. When your order is ready to ship, you will receive an email from the Starlink team and you will have 7 days to complete your order, otherwise it will be automatically cancelled and fully refunded.Â 

Within each coverage area, orders are fulfilled on a first-come, first-served basis.Â Our ability to provide service is driven by our networkâ€™s capacity, country and regional licensing and regulations, and Starlink Kit production.

Our network is limited in the number of users we can accommodate in any one area, based on the design of our low Earth orbit satellite constellation. This means that in areas with high demand, there will be longer wait times for some customers. Fulfilling more orders in these areas will require additional satellite launches and network improvements. As soon as someone moves out or cancels Starlink in a full area, we immediately replace them with the next person in line.Â
